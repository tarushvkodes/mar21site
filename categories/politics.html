                <p>Israel launched a ground invasion in Gaza today, significantly intensifying its conflict with Hamas. Reports indicate that over 200 Palestinian children have died since the ceasefire ended earlier this week, raising international concerns about the humanitarian crisis in the region.</p>
                
                <p>The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) stated that the operation targets Hamas military infrastructure, while Palestinian authorities have condemned the action as disproportionate and indiscriminate. The United Nations Security Council has called for an emergency session to address the escalating violence.</p>
                
                <p>International aid organizations report severe shortages of medical supplies, food, and clean water in Gaza, with hospitals overwhelmed by casualties. Several countries have called for an immediate ceasefire and the protection of civilians.</p>

                <blockquote>
                    "We are witnessing a catastrophic humanitarian situation that requires immediate international intervention," said the UN Secretary-General in a statement released this afternoon.
                </blockquote>

                <p>Protests have erupted in major cities worldwide, both in support of Palestinian civilians and in solidarity with Israel's security concerns.</p>

                <p>The United States conducted multiple airstrikes targeting Houthi infrastructure in Yemen today, continuing its efforts to protect maritime shipping lanes in the Red Sea. The Pentagon confirmed that the strikes targeted radar installations, drone launch sites, and weapons storage facilities.</p>
                
                <p>The operation comes in response to recent Houthi attacks on commercial vessels in the region, which have disrupted global shipping and raised insurance costs for maritime transport. U.S. officials stated that the strikes were conducted with precision to minimize civilian casualties.</p>
                
                <p>The Houthi movement, which controls significant portions of Yemen, has been targeting ships it claims are linked to Israel or its allies, stating their actions are in solidarity with Palestinians. Iranian officials have denied direct control over the Houthis, likely to avoid direct escalation with the United States.</p>

                <p>Maritime security experts note that the ongoing conflict has forced many shipping companies to reroute vessels around the Cape of Good Hope, adding significant costs and delays to global supply chains.</p>

                <p>Russian forces carried out multiple drone attacks on the Ukrainian port city of Odesa today, damaging civilian infrastructure and injuring at least three people, according to Ukrainian officials. The attack targeted port facilities and energy infrastructure, causing temporary power outages in parts of the city.</p>
                
                <p>Ukrainian air defenses reportedly shot down several drones, but others reached their targets. The attack comes amid a recent intensification of Russian operations along the eastern front and increased naval activity in the Black Sea.</p>
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Presidents Trump and Putin held a 90-minute phone call discussing the Ukraine conflict. The White House described the call as "frank and productive," though no specific agreements were announced. Critics expressed concern that the discussion took place without Ukrainian representation.</p>

                <p>The European Union announced today additional sanctions on Belarus for its role in supporting Russia's war efforts, targeting key sectors of the Belarusian economy and several high-ranking officials.</p>

                <h2>Department of Education Closure Order Signed</h2>

                </div>
                <p>President Trump signed an executive order today to begin the process of dismantling the U.S. Department of Education, fulfilling a campaign promise to return control of education policy to state and local governments. The announcement has sparked nationwide protests from educators, teachers' unions, and student organizations.</p>
                
                <p>The executive order initiates a 180-day transition period during which the Department's functions will either be eliminated or transferred to other federal agencies. The administration stated that federal education funding would be converted into block grants to states with minimal federal oversight.</p>
                
                <p>Critics argue that the move could exacerbate educational inequality, particularly for students with disabilities and those in underserved communities who have historically benefited from federal protections and funding. Supporters contend that the change will reduce bureaucracy and allow for more innovative local approaches to education.</p>

                <p>Two federal judges have already ordered the rehiring of dismissed federal employees, but the White House has announced plans to appeal these decisions, setting up a likely legal battle over the constitutionality of the executive order.</p>
                
                <p>Thousands of students walked out of schools and universities today in protest, with demonstrations occurring in Washington D.C., New York, Chicago, and other major cities.</p>
